Once the Super Sudoku.apk app is open, 8 puzzle options are presented.
The two columns display the type of board provided; either from a set of pregenerated boards or a new unique board.
Selecting a difficulty option from the pregenerated column displays a list of available puzzles.
The four rows rate the puzzle difficulty from easy to extreme.
The settings menu (wrench icon in the top right) is available from any screen. This menu allows the user to 
  adjust the sound and color settings as well as to exit the app.

Once a sudoku puzzle has been loaded, the user has several tools avaiable.
The number and options bar below the board display contains buttons for the numbers 1-9, clear tile, add note, and
  quick fill options.
  
The player is able to select any available cell and choose a number to place it in. A player-filled cell can be 
  selected and cleared at any time.
Selecting a cell and choosing the note option allows players to add a list of numbers they think possible for a given cell.
  While note is selected, all nine numbers can be added to a note. Removing note numbers is done by reselecting the desired
  number. Notes are covered but not erased when a number is added to the cell.
Selecting the quick fill option allows players to choose a number followed by any cells they wish to add it to.
If the chosen number for a cell causes a conflict, the row, column, or quadrent will highlight red.
The quick fill and annotation features can be used in conjunction.
